          # FileETag Digest for stable Etags accross loadbalanced servers for mounted files.
          #   "FileETag Digest" is acceptable here because these are only small files so
          #   having to read the full content of the file instead of just the filesystem
          #   metadata is not prohibitedly expensive. A better alternative would be to find
          #   a way to have stable filesystem metadata on all servers because:
          #   - accessing file system metadata is a lot less expensive.
          #   - contrary to apache httpd, nginx doesn't have an option to change the ETag
          #     generation method and always uses the filesystem metadata (size, mtime),
          #     so using "FileEtag Digest" locks us in with apache httpd.
          #   NOTE: this doesn't apply to files in the image (their filesystem metadata
          #   is the same because it's from the image), only to mounted files (bind mount
          #   or volume mount in docker compose, configmap in kubernetes)
          #   NOTE2: Because we use single file bind mounts for our files, the contents
          #   and filesystem metadata of our files fall out of sync between the host and
          #   the containers when the file is deleted or replaced (more precisely, as
          #   soon as the inode number of the file changes) (this can happen quite silently
          #   if your editor replaces the file when saving), but this means using Digest doesn't
          #   solve this issue. This is a known docker limitation: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6011
