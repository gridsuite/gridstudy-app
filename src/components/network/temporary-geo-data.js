    This object stores the geo data that are collected from the server AFTER the initialization.
    The bunch of geo data requested at the initialization of the map are stored as permanent data. It will not be requested again.
    The delta of geo data that is needed after the initialization is tagged as temporary. Each time some new geo data is requested, the full delta is downloaded.

    This workaround is required in the case of line/substation creation. By example, the position of a substation can change after being connected to one or two lines
    and this position would need to be requested again.
    It will be possible to have a better mechanism after we improved the notification system.
